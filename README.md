# Fashion-MNIST Classifier

Classifies images from the [Fashion-MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist). Inspired by the classic [MNIST dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), Fashion-MNIST consists of 60,000 training examples and 10,000 testing examples of various clothing articles on a 28x28 grayscale image. The purpose of this dataset is to provide a more challenging dataset than MNIST to validate computer vision models on.

There are 10 categories of clothing.

| Label | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 0     | T-shirt/top |
| 1     | Trouser     |
| 2     | Pullover    |
| 3     | Dress       |
| 4     | Coat        |
| 5     | Sandal      |
| 6     | Shirt       |
| 7     | Sneaker     |
| 8     | Bag         |
| 9     | Ankle boot  |

## Obtaining the Data

The data can be acquired from the [Fashion-MNIST GitHub repo](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#get-the-data). The files should be unzipped and stored in `fashion-mnist-classifier/data`.
